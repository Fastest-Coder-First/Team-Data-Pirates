# Weather Information Retrieval

This Markdown file demonstrates how to retrieve weather information for a specific city using the `requests` library in Python. The code fetches the weather information for the city "Kolkata" from the [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) website and prints the response text.

## Architecture Flow Description

The architectural flow for retrieving weather information using the `requests` library is as follows:

1. Define the city for which you want to retrieve weather information. In this example, we use the city "Kolkata".

2. Construct the URL by formatting the city name into the `https://wttr.in/{city}` format.

3. Use the `requests.get()` function to send a GET request to the constructed URL.

4. Retrieve the response using the `.text` attribute of the response object.

5. Print the response text, which contains the weather information for the specified city.

## Code Example

```python
import requests

city = "Kolkata"

url = "https://wttr.in/{}".format(city)

res = requests.get(url)

print(res.text)

```

## Using GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, can be helpful in writing code more efficiently. Here are a few ways it can assist:

- Auto-completion: Copilot suggests code completions as you type, helping you quickly complete function names, variable names, and method calls. For example, when typing `requests.get()`, Copilot can suggest the correct syntax.

- Code generation: Copilot can generate code snippets based on contextual information. It can assist in constructing the URL by providing suggestions for string formatting and concatenation.

- Error handling: Copilot can provide suggestions for error handling, such as try-except blocks, when you encounter exceptions or potential errors in your code.

- API usage: Copilot can assist in using APIs by suggesting the correct API endpoints, request parameters, and handling the response data. For example, it can help with handling different status codes and parsing the JSON response.

GitHub Copilot can significantly speed up the development process by reducing the time spent on writing boilerplate code and providing accurate suggestions based on the context. It can be a valuable tool for developers looking to improve their productivity and code quality.

To benefit from GitHub Copilot, you can install the Copilot extension in your preferred code editor and enable it to provide code suggestions while you write. It can learn from your coding style and adapt to your preferences over time, making it an even more powerful assistant in your development workflow.

With GitHub Copilot, you can write code faster, more accurately, and with reduced cognitive load, enabling you to focus on solving higher-level problems and building better software.
